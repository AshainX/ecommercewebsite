django from scratch VSCode

Installing depenencies(){

pip install virtualenv // environment install
pip install django 
pip install django-rest-framework
pip install django-cors-header// cross origin resource sharing ( CORS ) handles server headers 
pip install djoser // authentication bakckend
pip install pillow /// pil for image only
pip install stripe // API syncs your Stripe Data to your local database as pre-implemented Django Models allowing you to use the Django ORM, in your code, to work with the data making it easier and faster.

}

adding dependencies in settings.py{

 1st -    installed_apps = [



         'rest_framework',
         'rest_framework_authtoken',
         'corsheader',
         'djoser',

    ]

 2nd  -  CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
     "http://localhost:8000", //Liveserver
    ]

 3rd  -  MIDDLEWARE = [
    .....
    ....
    'corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware'// 
    ....
    ......
 ]

}

adding dependencies in urls.py{
    from django.urls import path, include
   
    urlpatterns = [

    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('api/v1/', include('djoser.urls')),
    path('api/v1/', include('djoser.urls.authtoken')),
]
}

adding database {

}

//change directory to python project using cd command
run python manage.py migrate to add database

now we can check how that works by running it in the server
by typing 'python manage.py runserver'

setting admin password and id ( superuser )
python manage.py createsuperuser 
enter user id and password and save it// 

next step is to install  vue js
open up project location in windows and on the top of searching type cmd and hit enter
in cmd type 'npm install -g @vue/cli'

now create vue project by typing 
'vue create [projectname]_vue'

now select manually which project u want to do
// example here 
    ? Please pick a preset: Manually select features
  ? Check the features needed for your project: Babel, Router, Vuex, CSS Pre-processors
  ? Choose a version of Vue.js that you want to start the project with 3.x
  ? Use history mode for router? (Requires proper server setup for index fallback in production) Yes
  ?  Pick a CSS pre-processor (PostCSS, Autoprefixer and CSS Modules are supported by default): Sass/SCSS (with dart-sass)
  ?  Where do you prefer placing config for Babel, ESLint, etc.? In dedicated config files
  ? Save this as a preset for future projects? (y/N) N
//
let the cmd install  these dependencies onto your project

now cd to vue [project] 
type npm install axios 

and install npm install bulma // which is a css style 
 
 we can now add fonts of choice  i have used font awesome so added it to project1vue/public/index.html
